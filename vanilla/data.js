        desc: `In October 2023, Adobe released Edge Delivery Services, a new product in the Adobe Experience Manager family that provides a blazing fast web ecosystem for their customers. I was part of the internal team that implemented this new technology on Adobe's own websites, defining a design system in a library of components that the entire web department of the company would eventually use. Delicate attention to detail and broad collaboration were of paramount importance in making this a successful transition. Contributions to this project were a balancing act between performance (with a high expectation of Lighthouse scores), ease of use by the authoring team (those who would actually be building pages for the site), and visual appeal approved by the design team. Thanks to this work, we were able to bring Adobe's average Lighthouse scores from the low 30's all the way up to the 90's. Today, there are very few pages on Adobe's vast web presence that don't contain at least some of my work.`,

        desc: 'Egg yolks are simultaneously amorphous, in motion, and somehow uniquely recognizable. Recreating this visual effect for Happy Egg with web technologies was an undeniable challenge, but through careful and efficient integration of user interaction and WebGL animations, I was able to reproduce the "feel" of an egg yolk interspersed with engaging visual content explaining egg-xactly how a Happy Egg is produced. I developed a novel integration of Django and Vue.js to give both the user and client the best of both worlds, a powerful and capable CMS and a snappy, adaptive front-end. Thanks to the hard work I and the rest of the team put into this site, we won awards from the [[CSS Design Awards|https://www.cssdesignawards.com/sites/happy-egg-co/36835/]], [[W3 Awards|https://www.w3award.com/winners/gallery/?award=1&event=1037&search=thinkingbox]], and [[Awwwards|https://www.awwwards.com/sites/happy-egg]].',

Pairing that fact with the prestige that comes with Adobe's reputation in the creative space, it goes without saying that expectations were high when my team was tasked with building an experience to show off statistics from Adobe's Experience Manager products. Through a combination of Vue.js, WebGL, CSS animations, and an extremely thorough exploration of SVG, we were able to build a presentation of data tailored to users' specific areas of business that kept them interested through dozens of data points. Our work was recognized with awards from [[The Webby Awards|https://winners.webbyawards.com/2019/apps-and-software/mobile-ott-app-features/best-visual-design-aesthetic/80614/adobe-mobile-maturity]] and [[Awwwards|https://www.awwwards.com/sites/adobe-2018-mobile-study]].

In 2016, this became my sole responsibility at Welikesmall, an undertaking that was both an honor and a challenge. Using Django as a backend to allow my coworkers to contribute to the site's content, Bootstrap's new (at the time) Flexbox build for frontend styles, and a barebones build of jQuery plus a scroll-based animation library called Waypoints for interactivity, I was able to build a site that felt both carefully thought-out and designed while maintaining an impressive “wow” factor. Later that year, I was honored to receive both a Site of the Day and a Dev Award for this project from [[Awwwards|https://www.awwwards.com/sites/welikesmall-agency]].`,

Menus and offerings differ between locations, so we created a UX strategy and data architecture that delivers localized information to each customer. Compiling seasonal and changing menus for 65 different locations in 14 languages—all while simplifying the user experience—was a unique challenge. Addressing accessibility needs, data structuring and a whole lot of backend customization brought this project together in the end. Technologies used for this project included a highly customized Django backend, and SCSS and pure vanilla javascript for the frontend.
